Java
====

A learning experience. Decided to learn java, and to do so I'll be making a game. 
Will probably be messy and have silly things but hey I'm new to all of its features.

To-do:
	For the initial version:
		lots of stuff. I'll be more specific later
	After that:
		LOTS of stuff. I'll also be more specific later


Reminders:
  Have a lot of different resources later on, with different workers for each resource buildings and different ways to get resources, for example:
    Farm:
      Bonus food production on normal/fertile land
        Worker: Farmer
    Hunter's Lodge:
      Gatherer: Hunter (gathers animal corpses)
      Bonus food production in woods/forest
        Worker: Butcher (provides food from animals)
      Bonus leather/fur production
        Worker: Tanner (provides leather from animals)
    Fishing Wharf:
      Gatherer: Fisherman
      Food production from water tiles
        Worker: Fish Gutter
